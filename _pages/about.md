I am a master student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), advised by [Prof. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). During my study at ETH, I also work remotely with [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) for the development of [MetaDriverse](https://metadriverse.github.io/). Before I came to Zurich, I did an internship at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) for a year, working with [Dr. Chunxiao Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4m061tYAAAAJ). I received my bachelor degree at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) before the internship.

I am interested in developing Embodied AI that is capable of modeling, predicting and generating human-level behaviors.
