I earned my Master's degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control from ETH Zurich, under the guidance of [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges). During my studies at ETH, I collaborated remotely with [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) in the development of [MetaDriverse](https://metadriverse.github.io/). Prior to arriving in Zurich, I completed a year-long internship at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en), working with [Dr. Chunxiao Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4m061tYAAAAJ). I received my Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University.

My interest lies in the development of Embodied AI capable of modeling, predicting, and generating human-like behaviors.
