Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at EPFL, advised by Prof. Alexandre Alahi. 

I am interested in advancing deep learning methodologies through a data-centric perspective. My research explores questions such as attributing model predictions to specific training data, selecting optimal data for diverse tasks, and modeling data distributions with generative models. I am particularly focused on applying data-centric techniques to large language models (LLMs), robotics, and computer vision, aiming to uncover insights into deep learning phenomenaâ€”including scaling laws, emergence, and in-context learning.
